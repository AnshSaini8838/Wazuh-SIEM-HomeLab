# Wazuh SIEM/XDR Home Lab – SOC Analyst Defensive Project

## Overview
This project documents my **hands-on practice** setting up a defensive cybersecurity home lab using **Wazuh** (SIEM + XDR).  
The lab simulates a SOC (Security Operations Center) environment where logs and events from a **Windows endpoint** are monitored, analyzed, and visualized in a **Wazuh Manager** running on **Ubuntu**.

**Skills Practiced:**
- SIEM & XDR deployment
- Network configuration (bridged adapter)
- Agent–Manager integration
- File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)
- Log analysis and event verification

---

## Lab Architecture

**Components:**
- **Ubuntu Server VM** → Wazuh Manager
- **Windows 10 VM** → Wazuh Agent
- **Network** → Bridged Adapter (same subnet for communication)

Windows Host (Agent) <----> Ubuntu VM (Manager)

### 3️⃣ Access the Wazuh Dashboard
Follow these steps to log in to your new Wazuh environment.

1. Find Your Server's IP Address

You will need the IP address of your Ubuntu server to access it from a web browser. Run one of the following commands in the server's terminal. The modern command is ip a.

```Bash
# Modern command (recommended)
ip a
```
or the older ifconfig command (you may need to install it first with apt install net-tools).
```Bash
# Older command
ifconfig
```
Look for the inet address listed under your primary network interface (e.g., eth0 or ens33). It will look something like 192.168.1.100.

2. Open in Browser: On a separate computer on the same network, open a web browser and go to https://YOUR_UBUNTU_IP_ADDRESS.

3. Accept Security Warning: Your browser will show a security warning because the installer uses a self-signed certificate. Click "Advanced" and "Proceed" to continue.

4. Log In: Use the credentials from the installation output to log in.
Username: admin

  Password: <The randomly generated password you saved from Step 2>

### 4️⃣ Installingthe Wazuh Agent (Windows Host)

sudo /var/ossec/bin/manage_agents
```
● Select A to add an agent.

● Assign a name (e.g., WindowsHost).

● Leave IP address blank unless static assignment is needed.

● After creation, select E to extract the key.

● Copy the key output.

5.2 Apply Key in the Windows Agent

1. Open Wazuh Agent Manager GUI from the Start Menu.
2. Paste the copied key into the appropriate field.
3. Save and apply the key.
